# 💫 About Me:
I am an AI & Computer Vision Engineer with strong experience in building real-time detection, tracking, and analytics systems for robotics, surveillance, and automation. I hold a Master’s degree in Electrical & Computer Engineering from the University of Ottawa, and I specialize in YOLO-based object detection, multi-object tracking, action recognition, and edge deployment.<br><br>I have delivered end-to-end solutions across PPE compliance, human behavior analysis, and robotics navigation using PyTorch, OpenCV, and advanced deep learning architectures. My work spans cloud and edge systems, including optimized video pipelines, multi-model inference, and integrating AI into robotic platforms. I’m passionate about solving real-world problems with robust AI models and building scalable systems that operate reliably in challenging environments.
